# 2D Game in Python

# Introduction
Hey, my name is Matou≈° and I'm a Czech High School student. This file serves as documentation for my long-term graduation work. At least for the time being. My goal for this project is to create a 2D videogame in Python using OOP and the Pygame module.

# Expectations
The game will consist of two parts. The first one will be an interactive menu that you can navigate through. The second part will be the game itself. It will be an arcade medival styled game, where your main goal is to defeat your oponent using your special attacks. The game will be played by two players on the same computer. It will feature two unique heroes. Both of them will also have their own animations in idle, running and attacking positions. The first one inspired by my favourite manga Berserk, specifically by its main hero Guts. The second hero is inspired by one of the main characters of Terry Pratchetts Discworld books about the Wizards, Rincewind \(even though he can't actually cast any spells in the books :D).

This file is going to be updated regularly until I finish my work and submit it.
